Lecture 02
==========

Before Class:
-------------
I watched class videos
DAS (Direct Attached Storage) is common way we daily used, hard drive and OS are in laptop
which we have direct access to them.
NAS (Network Attached Storage) is both the filesystem , and hard drive or storage are in a remote server
which we need to remotely access as a shared hard drive
SAN (Storage Area Network) is simliart to the NAS, however, the storage is seperate from the filesystem,
the filesystem is not bind to one storage, instead, have access to multiple storages as local device. 

Question about different type of file systems, I am not very clear about them. hope Jan would clear that in the lecture.

After Class:
------------
I got a better understanding about between the gap about file system and operating system.
There're some key point I got

1. Hide file using mount

If you mount a folder, the folder content will be whatever your mount point have,
however, if the folder already got some files before the mount...
It won't be delete! You can only see it by unmount the folder!
Really a cool way to hide file, I think it's a very secret technique

2. What're files

There're Two main things we need to know. Inode, and its content
When we access a file, what's it really do is 
    1. get file's inode number
    2. go to the address for the inode, grap the content
    3. give it back to you
And when you delete the file, the content didn't got delete!
It simply remove the inode which the file attached to, so you cannot access the content, unless you have a hard link of that file which remember the inode.
