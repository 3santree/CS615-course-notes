Lecture 02
==========

Before Class:
-------------
I watched class videos
DAS (Direct Attached Storage) is common way we daily used, hard drive and OS are in laptop
which we have direct access to them.
NAS (Network Attached Storage) is both the filesystem , and hard drive or storage are in a remote server
which we need to remotely access as a shared hard drive
SAN (Storage Area Network) is simliart to the NAS, however, the storage is seperate from the filesystem,
the filesystem is not bind to one storage, instead, have access to multiple storages as local device. 

Question about different type of file systems, I am not very clear about them. hope Jan would clear that in the lecture.
