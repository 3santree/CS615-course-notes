Lecture 01
==========

Before Class:
-------------
I go through the course website and read the email that Jan send to us
Need to prepare github repo and boot up NetBSD instance on AWS
my AWS free tier account expired, I need to register using another.

After Class:
------------
It's interesting that Jan asked us about "Do you guys back up your personal laptop/PC?"
Of course no one did that, and Jan follows "Then How you gonna do when all your files got lost? "

Which is exactly what I was thinking when I found out my (7 years old) macbook is broken days after.... Luckily, there's no important files, and I could dissemble it and get the hard drive.
